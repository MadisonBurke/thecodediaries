The Code Diaries :

The site is basically a giant online guild, focused on technical skill development. I use the word 'guild' to capture the large but closed community. 
The site's aspects include: Forums, Teams, Projects, and possibly a [Towns]quare. 

Forums - A place Where coders can post project ideas, make requests to find teammates or request that projects be completed for them. I expect to see complaints about bugs on the site, artist threads, threads about Townsquare, roleplaying, tutorials, anime, homework, video games, etc.
   -  The forums run on instant messenger technology  - which will be the hidden magic of the site.

Teams - Users have the option to create and join teams, which are like MMO parties. Teams have team leaders, and are typically small in size but not necessarily. The main use of teams is for the team chat filter, and we can allow the joining of multiple teams at a time. 

Projects - People can announce their project ideas in the projects forum (coders looking for comments, clients looking for labor, etc). We will let users mark/follow threads, which will be accessible from their user accounts. 

Town square - A simple but attractive virtual reality application, which lets users roam around an environment with their avatar. Based on gaia towns. 

Big Picture - The large instant messenger forum should be the main attraction imo, and the heart of the site. The towns is an embellishment, and he site should be able to fully function without it for me to consider it correct.
