# The Code Diaries 

This website uses the Node.js socket.js technology to make a forum of chat rooms. 
You can use this stellar tutorial by Brad Traversy to get started with socket.io instant messenger techniques:

The current version of the website allows you to make a user name, and then create or join a chat room.
In the end, I would like to have "chatrooms within chatrooms" (please no chatception jokes). What I mean, is that I would like users to create "Channels", in which visitors can make their rooms.

Feel free to rip the code.
